- Part 1: Sequential
    - [x] Register start time
    - [x] Read the csv file
    - [x] Construct the elbow graph and find the optimal clusters number (k).
    - [x] Cluster the data using the optimum value using k-means.
    - [x] Find the cluster with the highest sequence length and compute its average sequence length.
    - [x] Measure end time and print execution time (end-start)
    - [x] Plot results of the execution:
        - [x] Elbow graph.
        - [x] Clusters with centroids.
        - [x] Heat map using the values of the clustersâ€™ centroids.
        - [ ] For the cluster with highest sequence length, print id, highest value, average sequence length previously computed.

- Part 2: Multiprocessing
    - [ ] Write a parallel version of you program using multiprocessing.
    - [ ] Measure the time and optimize the program to get the fastest version you can.
    - [ ] Measure time and print it
    - [ ] Plot the results as in the serial version.

- Part 3: Threading
    - [ ] Write a parallel version of you program using threads
    - [ ] Measure the time and optimize the program to get the fastest version you can.
    - [ ] Measure time and print it
    - [ ] Plot the results as in the serial version.
